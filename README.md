# DYNAMITE

DYNAMITE uses population-level statistics to test models and predict the presence and some characteristics of currently unknown planets in multi-planet systems. The Python source code is located in the "src" directory.

## New in Version 3.0

Please run dynamite_targets_db.py to create a target database. If no already created database or CSV files with planetary parameters are input via the config file, this will automatically create one from the NASA Exoplanet Archive table and the ExoFOP-TESS table.
